# LinkedIn Audit — Riché Zamor

Monthly audit of Riché's LinkedIn presence. Runs first Sunday of each month at 8:30pm America/New_York via Claude Cowork shortcut, or manually via `/rz-linkedin-audit` in Claude Code. Produces a structured Notion page, issues up to 3 prioritized Linear tasks, and posts a single-line headline to Slack.

LinkedIn is the primary surface for Riché's professional brand. Website is secondary. X is published-to but not audited (deferred). The audit feeds the newsletter launch decision and the engagement-rate diagnostic.

## Cross-skill dependencies (read these first)

The audit is a tactical skill. It does not own voice canon or audience strategy. It LEVERAGES sources owned by other role-based skills.

**Brand voice is owned by `rz-copywriting`.** Pull from `corpus/voice/` for the Fatal Fifteen AI-tells list, voice anti-patterns, and the 50/30/20 domain balance frame. The audit's P6 voice checks are detection rules ON TOP of the voice canon; they do NOT redefine voice rules.

**Audience strategy is owned by `rz-growth-marketing`.** Pull from `corpus/growth/` for the ICP definition (VP/CPO/founder-level operators at Series A-C AI companies), audience flywheel logic, and the engagement quality framework. P2 and P3 reference these as source of truth. The LinkedIn export workflow Riché runs monthly lives at `corpus/growth/playbook/linkedin-monthly-dump-workflow.md`.

If a corpus entry's text contradicts these source-of-truth corpora, the source-of-truth corpora win. Surface the contradiction in `rz-self-improve` for cleanup.

**Notion DB property names (canonical):** `Audit` (title), `Audit Date`, `Period Start`, `Period End`, `Overall Status`, `Posts Published`, `Total Impressions`, `Engagement Rate`, `Avg Impressions Per Post`, `Net Follower Growth`, `Total Followers EOP`, `ICP Match Pct`, `Top Format`, `Top Domain`, `Domain Mix Drift`, `Gate 1 Impressions`, `Gate 2 Engagement`, `Gate 3 ICP Quality`, `Gate 4 Waitlist`, `Linear Tasks Issued`, `Deep Dive Candidates`. Overall Status options: `Green` / `Yellow` / `Red` (no emoji prefix in the DB; emoji used in the page body and Slack post).

## Process

### Step 1 — Bootstrap
Per `methodology/bootstrap.md`:
1. Verify required MCP connectors are reachable (Notion, Linear, Slack, Google Drive).
2. Find the latest export in `DRIVE_EXPORT_FOLDER_PATH`. Identify the previous-month export for the diff baseline.
3. Read Posts Master, Snapshots, Monthly Summary tabs from the Master Tracker.
4. Read Content Topics DB rows that match the period (for format/domain mapping of new posts).
5. Read Competitors DB rows where Tier ∈ {Direct, Aspirational}.
6. Initialize an empty findings buffer keyed by pillar.

### Step 2 — Parse the export
Per `methodology/export-parsing.md`. Read all 5 sections: DISCOVERY, ENGAGEMENT, TOP POSTS by Engagements, TOP POSTS by Impressions, FOLLOWERS, DEMOGRAPHICS. Surface any parsing anomalies (unexpected schema changes from LinkedIn) as a P0 finding under P1 Reach & Velocity.

### Step 3 — Update the Master Tracker
Per `methodology/master-tracker-update.md`. Upsert Posts Master, append Snapshots rows, append Monthly Summary row. Refresh the Compounders, Late Bloomers, and Format Decay Curves views (formula-driven; no manual recompute needed). For new posts not yet in Content Topics DB, write them to a `Unclassified Posts` log for manual tagging.

### Step 4 — Run the six pillars
For each pillar corpus entry, evaluate against parsed export + updated tracker. Write findings to the buffer with severity (P0/P1/P2). Order:

1. P1 Reach & Velocity
2. P2 Audience Composition
3. P3 Thesis Resonance
4. P4 Conversion & North Star
5. P5 Competitive Benchmarking
6. P6 Voice & Brand Hygiene

P5 is the longest block (~10 minutes for web_fetch on Direct + Aspirational competitors).

### Step 5 — Identify Deep Dive candidates
Per `methodology/deep-dive-candidate-selection.md`. Using `DEEP_DIVE_CRITERION`, select 5 post URLs. Write to the Notion audit page property `Deep Dive Candidates` as comma-separated. Do NOT enrich — that's a separate sub-workflow Riché triggers manually.

### Step 6 — Newsletter gate check
Compute current state for each of the 4 gates. Mark each as Met / Not Met / Approaching. The audit narrative includes a one-line trajectory ("Engagement rate trending +0.05pp/month — at this rate, gate 2 is met in {N} months").

### Step 7 — Assemble report
Per `methodology/report-assembly.md`. Build the audit page in memory. Compute headline color: Green if all 6 pillars at P2 or better AND no newsletter gate regressed; Yellow if 1–2 P1 findings OR a gate regressed; Red if any P0 finding OR 2+ gates regressed. Do not write to Notion yet.

### Step 8 — Issue tasks
Per `methodology/task-issuance.md`. Take the top P0 + P1 findings, capped at `MAX_MONTHLY_TASKS` (3). Create Linear issues in `LINEAR_PROJECT_ID`, assigned to `LINEAR_ASSIGNEE_ID`, with due dates spread Mon–Wed–Fri across the first week of the month. Use the create-then-update pattern. Capture the TRZ-### IDs.

### Step 9 — Write Notion page
Single write to the Monthly LinkedIn Audits DS (`NOTION_LINKEDIN_AUDIT_DS_ID`). Page title format: `LinkedIn Audit — {Month YYYY}`. Properties per `databases/monthly-audits-notion-schema.md`. Include the Linear TRZ-### IDs in the `Linear Tasks Issued` property and the body's Linear Tasks Issued section. Set `Overall Status` last, after task issuance is confirmed.

### Step 10 — Slack notification
Per `methodology/slack-notification.md`. One-line headline to `SLACK_CHANNEL` with traffic-light emoji, period name, key finding, task count, and Notion page link.

## Deep dive sub-workflow (manual trigger)

Triggered by Riché after he reviews the audit's Deep Dive Candidates list. Invocation: `/rz-linkedin-audit deep-dive {post-url}` or natural-language equivalent. Per `corpus/linkedin-audit/deep-dive/enrichment-checklist.md`, gather:

- Engagement type breakdown (reactions, comments, bookmarks, shares — NOT in the bulk export)
- Commenter list with ICP match flagged
- Click data where applicable
- Post copy and thesis classification
- Comments themed (substantive vs. drive-by)
- Inferred mechanism

Source: LinkedIn Community Management API once the context management system has it; manual or browser-assisted in the meantime. Output: appended to the current month's Notion audit page as a "Deep Dive: {post URL}" sub-section.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not draft or publish content. P3 fires Linear tasks; Riché writes via `/rz-draft-content`.
- It does not auto-tag posts by Format or Domain. Tagging is done in the Content Topics DB at publish time. Untagged posts surface as Unclassified for manual cleanup.
- It does not measure X. X is published-to but not audited (deferred).
- It does not enrich Deep Dive candidates automatically. That's a separate sub-workflow Riché triggers per candidate.
- It does not own voice canon or audience strategy. Reads those from `rz-copywriting` and `rz-growth-marketing`.
- It does not compute follower-count gates. The follower-count newsletter gate is retired (Riché surpassed it). Engagement quality is the gate.
- It does not create the Master Tracker Google Sheet. Riché creates it once per `databases/master-tracker-sheet-schema.md`.

## Cross-skill connections

**Upstream (the audit reads from these for canonical knowledge):**

- `rz-copywriting` — owns the Fatal Fifteen AI-tells list and 50/30/20 domain balance. P6 voice checks read from `corpus/voice/`.
- `rz-growth-marketing` — owns the ICP definition, audience flywheel, and the LinkedIn monthly export workflow. P2/P3 reference `corpus/growth/`; the export workflow (`linkedin-monthly-dump-workflow.md`) is the upstream cadence this audit depends on.
- `rz-website-audit` — shares the Competitors DB (`COMPETITORS_DB_ID`). P5 reads the same Direct + Aspirational tier rows used for the website audit's competitor benchmarking.

**Downstream (the audit hands off to these for fixes):**

- `rz-draft-content` — when P3 fires for low Context Intelligence engagement, the resulting Linear task may reference rz-draft-content for the next CI piece.
- `rz-copywriting` — P6 voice findings reference rz-copywriting's voice rules. The audit detects drift; rz-copywriting fixes it.
- `rz-quarterly-review` — reads the Monthly LinkedIn Audits DB (this skill's output) for trend context. The quarterly review now consumes monthly audit pages instead of re-parsing raw LinkedIn data.
- `rz-self-improve` — runs as the SessionEnd hook in retrospective mode; logs any audit-time exceptions for next-run improvement.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What goes wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Issuing more than 3 tasks per audit | Compounds into unmanageable backlog at monthly cadence | MAX_MONTHLY_TASKS = 3; reserve P2 findings for narrative-only |
| Treating P5 as P0/P1-eligible | P5 is informational; competitive findings inform strategy but don't seed tasks | Keep P5 narrative-only |
| Auto-enriching all 5 Deep Dive candidates | Burns 75-150 min on candidates that may not warrant it | Surface candidates in audit; Riché picks 0-5 to enrich manually |
| Skipping Voice Drift Sample because "the posts looked fine" | Voice drift is the silent killer; small-sample lint is the discipline | P6 always runs; 4 random posts every month |
| Modifying past Snapshots rows in the Master Tracker | Append-only discipline broken; time series corrupted | Surface bad rows as P2 anomalies; never rewrite |
| Writing Notion page before Step 8 completes | Linear Tasks Issued property becomes stale | Order matters: Step 8 (Linear) before Step 9 (Notion) before Step 10 (Slack) |
